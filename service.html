            <h2>Community and Service</h2>
            <p>
                Giving back to the community has been an important part of my life. Through Boy Scouts and other
                volunteer opportunities, I’ve been able to contribute to projects that directly benefit people
                and strengthen communities.

            <h3>Boy Scouts Service Projects</h3>
            <p>
                During my years in Boy Scouts, I participated in a variety of service projects, including creating
                a community garden for a local church, organizing a canned food drive to support families in need,
                and helping build sheds for storage at community spaces. These projects taught me teamwork,
                leadership, and the value of sustained service.

            <h3>Additional Community Service</h3>
            <p>
                Beyond Boy Scouts, I’ve taken part in other service activities such as local park clean-ups,
                assisting at charity fundraising events, and tutoring younger students in basic computer skills.
                Each experience gave me a chance to make a positive impact while learning from the people I worked with.

            <h3>Future Contributions</h3>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, I am interested in teaching workshops on software development and contributing
                to open-source projects. I see these as opportunities to support learners while staying engaged
                with real-world challenges in technology.
