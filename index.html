                I’m Sonith, a Computer Science student at Texas A&amp;M University with an interest in artificial
                intelligence, machine learning, and backend development. I enjoy building systems that work with
                data and create efficient solutions to real problems, and I look forward to applying these skills
                in my future career as a software engineer. This past summer I interned at Leidos, where I worked
                on developing automation solutions and building applications that improved efficiency for project
                teams. This experience strengthened my technical foundation and gave me insight into how software
                can create real impact in professional environments.

            <p>
                Outside of computer science, I like to keep life full of different experiences. I mainly enjoy travelling, which has taken me
                to Costa Rica, Hawaii, Turkey, Thailand, and New York, each place leaving me with new perspectives and
                memorable moments. Music is always part of my day, whether I’m studying or just relaxing. I also enjoy
                watching anime for its creativity and storytelling, and I make time for the gym to stay active and
                disciplined.
