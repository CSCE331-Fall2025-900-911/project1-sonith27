            <h2>Why I Chose Computer Science</h2>
            <p>When I was a kid, I always enjoyed solving puzzles and challenges. I liked spending time with Rubik’s
                cubes and brain teasers, always trying to find the solution. I also liked making things with my
                hands—drawing, painting, and folding origami. All of those activities gave me the same type of
                satisfaction: starting with something small and slowly building it into something complete. When I
                discovered computer science, I realized it gave me that same feeling. Coding lets me solve problems step
                by step, but it also lets me be creative and make something new that people can actually use.</p>
            <p>As I’ve gone deeper into CS, I’ve been able to use both my problem-solving and creative sides. In school,
                I’ve learned the fundamentals through courses in programming, data structures, and databases. Outside of
                class, I’ve worked on projects and internships where I got to apply what I learned. For example, I built
                tools that saved people time by automating tasks, created systems that organized messy data into
                something useful, and worked on research using sensors and Python to track motion. Each of these
                experiences showed me how computer science can take an idea and turn it into something real.</p>
            <p>Choosing computer science felt natural to me. It combines logic with creativity in a way that matches the
                things I’ve always enjoyed since I was younger. I like that I can use it to solve problems, make things
                more efficient, and also create projects that people find helpful. CS gives me the chance to build,
                improve, and innovate, and that’s why I’m excited to keep growing in this field.</p>
